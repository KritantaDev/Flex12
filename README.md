# Flex12

**Hello Friends**

##Wut is dis?

This is an implementation of FLEX for iOS 12 RootlessJB. The tweak [[FLEXing]] by NSExceptional (https://github.com/NSExceptional/FLEXing) is awesome, but unfortunately Activator has not been updated for iOS 12 RootlessJB yet. This is a very simple implementation that allows you to toggle FLEX from the home screen or lockscreen by force-touching the status bar.

##How dis werk?

Force-Touch the status bar. Does not work in apps yet bc of sandboxing limitations.

##Can I contribute?

yeh do one of those forky things

##Are there settings with a nice little icon?

of course


#License
